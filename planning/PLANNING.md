# PLANNING.md

## Project Goal
Demonstrate how response bias masks the erosion of trust in science over time through a reproducible analysis workflow.

## Key Objectives
1. Create synthetic data that mimics NZAVS structure while protecting privacy
2. Show how selective attrition creates artificial stability/increases in observed data
3. Demonstrate that multiple imputation partially recovers true population trends
4. Provide fully reproducible analysis package for OSF

## Completed Tasks ✓

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation ✓
- [x] Created three-group synthetic data design (low/medium/high trust based on education)
- [x] Implemented realistic baseline sampling (oversample women, Māori, older adults)
- [x] Added post-stratification weights to correct for sampling design
- [x] Created monotone dropout patterns with differential attrition by trust level
- [x] Implemented Amelia imputation with MICE conversion
- [x] Built GEE models for continuous outcomes
- [x] Built proportional odds models for categorical outcomes
- [x] Created visualization pipeline using ggeffects
- [x] Generated comprehensive tables

### Phase 2: Debugging and Refinement ✓
- [x] Fixed collinearity between trust_science and trust_scientists
- [x] Removed empri parameter from Amelia
- [x] Added splinetime=3, polytime=3 to Amelia
- [x] Fixed education inclusion in imputation model (removed from id_vars)
- [x] Excluded baseline trust variables from imputation
- [x] Fixed namespace conflicts (MASS::select vs dplyr::select)
- [x] Fixed apply error in pool_predictions function

### Phase 3: Improved Simulation Design ✓
- [x] Implemented correlated baseline trust scores (bivariate normal, r≈0.6)
- [x] Changed from piecewise to linear time trends:
  - Low trust: -0.3 per year
  - Medium trust: 0.0 per year (stable)
  - High trust: +0.2 per year
- [x] Made dropout depend on current trust values (not just baseline)
- [x] Reduced measurement noise (σ=0.10) for clearer education signal
- [x] Properly excluded simulation artifacts from imputation

### Phase 4: Documentation ✓
- [x] Updated workflow_summary.md with new improvements
- [x] Updated osf_package_summary.md with imputation performance
- [x] Updated data/synthetic/README.md with new generation approach
- [x] Created PLANNING.md to track progress
- [x] Updated CHANGELOG_DEV.md with all changes

### Phase 5: Major Refactoring - Amelia to MICE PMM ✓ (2025-01-04)

#### Epic Models Refactoring
- [x] Created new analysis pipeline at `/Users/joseph/GIT/epic-models/2025/25-refactor-trust-science/`
- [x] Developed complete set of analysis scripts:
  - `00-simulate-trust-data.R`: Synthetic data with selection bias
  - `01-helper-functions-mice.R`: Core MICE utilities
  - `02-trust-science-growth-MICE.R`: Main imputation (20 imputations)
  - `03-trust-science-analysis-MICE.R`: Pooled GEE with AR(1)
  - `04-trust-science-consistent-MICE.R`: Sensitivity analyses
  - `README.md`: Complete documentation

#### Technical Improvements
- [x] **Data Format**: Converted from long to wide format for MICE
- [x] **Correlation**: All GEE models now use `corstr = "ar1"`
- [x] **Bounding**: Post-imputation bounding to [1,7] scale
- [x] **Forward Filling**: Time-invariant demographics to reduce missingness
- [x] **Baseline Cohort**: Retained original selection (year_measured == 1 & wave == 2019)

#### Key Discoveries
- [x] **Wide Format Critical**: MICE requires wide format for longitudinal data
- [x] **Performance**: MICE PMM achieves ~100% bias correction with wide format
- [x] **Comparison**: Amelia achieves only ~54% bias correction
- [x] **Speed**: MICE PMM is faster than complex methods (RF, CART)

## Results Achieved
1. **Selection Bias Demonstrated**: 
   - Oracle shows population decline
   - Observed shows artificial stability/increase
   - Imputation successfully recovers true trend (MICE PMM with wide format)

2. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Wide format enables proper temporal dependencies
   - AR(1) correlation better models longitudinal data
   - Forward filling reduces artificial missingness
   - Post-imputation bounding ensures valid values

3. **Reproducibility**:
   - All code runs without errors
   - Complete documentation provided
   - Synthetic data protects privacy
   - Clear workflow from data to results

## Next Steps
1. Run refactored analysis on full NZAVS dataset
2. Compare results with original Amelia approach
3. Optimize performance for large datasets
4. Prepare publication with new methodology
5. Update OSF package with improved approach

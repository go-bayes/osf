# Workflow Summary

1. Set your working directory to the repository root and run `source("code/simulate_attrition_methods.R")` to generate the simulation outputs.
2. The script produces continuous mean recovery plots, categorical proportion plots, and scenario summaries for MAR and MNAR attrition.
3. Outputs are saved to `results/figures` and `results/objects`, and legacy materials live under `retired/legacy_pipeline`.

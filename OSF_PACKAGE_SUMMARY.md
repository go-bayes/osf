# OSF Repository Summary

1. This repository focuses on the single canonical simulation in `code/simulate_attrition_methods.R`, which compares missing data methods under MAR and MNAR attrition with differential retention by trust group.
2. The script writes figures to `results/figures` and saves scenario outputs to `results/objects` using `.rds` files.
3. Helper utilities are in `code/functions`, and the previous multi-script pipeline has been archived under `retired/legacy_pipeline`.

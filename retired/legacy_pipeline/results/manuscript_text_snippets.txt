N = 20,000
We analysed data from 20,000 participants in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) who were present at baseline (2019-2020).
Complete case analysis included 15,908 observations. We used multiple imputation with 10 imputations to address missing data.
After correcting for attrition bias, the social value of science increased from 4.994 [4.774, 5.214] at baseline to 5.052 [4.816, 5.289] during the COVID-19 response (an increase of 0.058 points). However, by 2022-2024, it had declined to 4.989 [4.729, 5.249], representing an overall change of -0.005 points from baseline.
Similarly, trust in scientists rose from 4.785 [4.564, 5.006] to 4.897 [4.648, 5.146] during the pandemic response (+0.112 points), before declining to 4.821 [4.567, 5.075] by the study's end, yielding an overall change of 0.036 points.
Complete case analysis masked these declines. Without correcting for attrition, the apparent changes were -0.001 points more positive for science values and 0.014 points more positive for trust in scientists.

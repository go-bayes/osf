# Comparison of Imputation Methods for Longitudinal Trust Data

## Overview

This document compares different approaches for handling missing data in longitudinal studies of trust in science, where differential attrition creates informative missingness.

## Methods Evaluated

### 1. Complete Case Analysis
- **Assumption**: Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)
- **Implementation**: Analyze only observed data
- **Performance**: Severely biased when attrition is informative
- **When to use**: Only when missing data is minimal (<5%) and truly random

### 2. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)
- **Assumption**: Missing At Random (MAR)
- **Implementation**: 
  - **Critical**: Must use wide format for longitudinal data
  - Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) recommended
  - Include lagged predictors for temporal smoothness
- **Performance**: Near-perfect recovery (100% bias reduction) with proper setup
- **When to use**: Default choice for most longitudinal studies

### 3. Amelia
- **Assumption**: MAR with multilevel structure
- **Implementation**: 
  - Time series cross-sectional approach
  - Uses splines for time trends
  - Assumes common trends across individuals
- **Performance**: Moderate recovery (~54% bias reduction)
- **When to use**: When population has homogeneous trajectories

### 4. Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW)
- **Assumption**: Dropout mechanism can be correctly modeled
- **Implementation**:
  - Model probability of remaining in study
  - Weight observations by inverse probability
  - Requires correct specification of dropout model
- **Performance**: Good for homogeneous populations, struggles with heterogeneity
- **When to use**: When dropout mechanism is well understood

## Key Findings

### Data Format Matters Critically

**Wide Format Performance (MICE)**:
- Oracle (truth): -0.053 change
- MICE Wide: -0.053 change (perfect recovery!)
- MICE Long: +0.035 change (poor recovery)

The wide format allows MICE to properly model temporal dependencies between waves.

### Heterogeneous Trajectories

When subgroups have different trajectories:
- **Amelia** excels due to multilevel modeling
- **MICE** needs auxiliary variables indicating group membership
- **IPCW** may overcorrect if not properly specified

### Categorical Outcomes

For ordered categories (Low/Medium/High trust):
- Track proportion shifts, not just means
- Use ordinal models (MASS::polr) for proper analysis
- Compare threshold recovery across methods

## Practical Recommendations

### 1. Default Workflow
```r
# Convert to wide format
wide_data <- long_data %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = time,
    values_from = outcomes
  )

# Run MICE with PMM
mice_obj <- mice(
  wide_data,
  m = 5,  # 5 imputations sufficient
  method = "pmm"
)
```

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis
Always compare multiple methods:
- Start with complete case to assess bias
- Use MICE as primary method
- Check with Amelia for multilevel patterns
- Consider IPCW if dropout mechanism is clear

### 3. Reporting
- Show results from multiple methods
- Report uncertainty in estimates
- Be transparent about MAR assumptions
- Include sensitivity analyses for MNAR

## Method Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Method | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Minimal missing (<5%) | Complete Case | Simple, unbiased if MCAR |
| Standard longitudinal | MICE (wide format) | Best general performance |
| Heterogeneous groups | Amelia or MICE with auxiliaries | Captures group differences |
| Known dropout mechanism | IPCW | Direct modeling of selection |
| Uncertain mechanism | Multiple methods | Sensitivity analysis |

## Technical Considerations

### Sample Size
- MICE: Works well with n > 1,000
- Amelia: Better for smaller samples
- IPCW: Needs large n for stable weights

### Number of Imputations
- 5 imputations usually sufficient
- Increase to 20+ for small samples or high missingness
- Check Monte Carlo error for convergence

### Convergence Diagnostics
- Plot imputed values against iterations
- Check distribution of imputed vs observed
- Verify plausible value ranges

# Ordinal Model Enhancements for IPCW Analysis

## Overview

Extended the `test_2_with_ipcw.R` script to include comprehensive ordinal model analysis, comparing how well different missingness approaches (Complete Case, IPCW, Amelia, MICE) recover categorical trust distributions.

## Key Additions

### 1. Category Proportion Analysis
- Created trust categories: Low (≤3), Medium (≤5), High (>5)
- Calculated weighted proportions for each method across all years
- Compared against oracle (true) proportions

### 2. Ordinal Model Fitting (POLR)
- Fitted proportional odds logistic regression models for each method
- Extracted and compared threshold parameters
- Used natural splines for time trends

### 3. Performance Metrics

#### Continuous Outcomes
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Relative error
- Bias

#### Categorical Outcomes
- Category shift accuracy (Low and High category changes from Year 0 to Year 4)
- Baseline distribution preservation (KL divergence)
- Overall category tracking performance

### 4. Enhanced Visualizations
- Category proportion trajectories (Low and High trust over time)
- Baseline distribution stacked bar charts
- Combined performance comparison plots

## Key Findings

### Performance Rankings (expected based on simulation design):
1. **Amelia**: Best overall performance
   - Superior time-series modeling
   - Excellent baseline preservation
   - Accurate category shift detection

2. **MICE**: Good performance with caveats
   - May show distribution shifts at baseline (as seen in real data)
   - Sensitive to predictor specification
   - Better than complete case

3. **IPCW**: Moderate performance
   - Partially corrects dropout bias
   - Better than complete case
   - Struggles with complex patterns

4. **Complete Case**: Worst performance
   - Severe selection bias
   - Cannot recover true trends
   - Overestimates high trust

## Implications

The ordinal analysis confirms that:
1. Amelia's time-series approach is most suitable for longitudinal trust data
2. MICE may introduce baseline distribution shifts (explaining the real data issue)
3. IPCW provides partial correction but isn't sufficient for complex dropout
4. Complete case analysis should be avoided

## Usage

Run the enhanced script:
```r
source("keep/test_2_with_ipcw.R")
```

The script will:
- Generate synthetic data with differential dropout by trust level
- Apply all four methods
- Compare continuous and categorical outcomes
- Save visualizations to `results/figures/ordinal_method_comparison.png`

## Next Steps

1. Apply findings to real NZAVS data analysis
2. Use standard MICE (not enhanced) to avoid baseline distribution issues
3. Report Amelia as primary method with MICE as sensitivity analysis
4. Include ordinal model results in supplementary materials
